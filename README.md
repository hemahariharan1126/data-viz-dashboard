# Data Visualization Dashboard
This repo contains a simple, real-world dashboard for interactive data exploration. It's perfect for sports/data/AI/ML folks who want answers—not just numbers.

Why?
I found most analytics tools were either way too complex or too basic. I wanted a project anyone can run, connect to a CSV or API, and visualize results fast—without a 100-page tutorial.

Features
- Plug in your CSV or public dataset, see live charts
- Filters, grouping, highlight insights
- Built with React, Plotly/D3.js, and Python (Flask backend for data crunching)
- Download graphs, export reports

Run:
Clone, install, run frontend/backend scripts; add your data file. Docs in /docs folder.

Commit with README only, no code, repo shell.
