## 🛠️ Why I Made This

I spent years wrestling with analytics tools that were either bloated enterprise software or too simplistic to be useful. During a sports analytics project, I needed to quickly visualize player stats and share insights with my team—but every tool I tried had a steep learning curve or required expensive licenses.

That frustration led me to build this: a straightforward dashboard that anyone can run locally, connect their data, and get visual answers in minutes, not hours. No 100-page manuals, no vendor lock-in—just clean, interactive visualizations.
